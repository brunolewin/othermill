## Welcome to CNC 101

These hands-on lessons will get you up to speed on the basics of CNC milling with the equipment we have at the Garage. You will start with the "Othermill" - an easy to use desktop mill that works great for milling small objects, engraving and making PCBs. The training is "self-service" but please drop a mail to **MakerGarageCNC** before getting started and if you need any help. Please don't request to join MakerGarageCNC, that is used for other purposes as your training continues.

## Part 1 - Othermill Basics - Apx 1 hour 
Link: [Hello World Project](helloworld)

_This is a prereq to using the Othermill for other projects._

This easy course will allow to learn basic operation of a CNC mill: getting familiar with the Othermill, installing tools, preparing material, running a job. 

It's hands on, take it at the Othermill setup in the B27 Garage. 

After taking this, you'll be able to explore other training material and projects from the [Other Machine site](https://othermachine.co/support/).

See [PCB Section in Garage Notebook](https://microsoft.sharepoint.com/teams/garage/maker/_layouts/OneNote.aspx?id=%2Fteams%2Fgarage%2Fmaker%2FSiteAssets%2FMaker%20Garage%20Notebook&wd=target%28CNC%20Mills.one%7C6E5D7373-3F0C-4CA8-8572-80182BFD2D85%2FPCBs%7C8C7DE9A3-99ED-4150-889C-67E4F97A738D%2F%29) for more tips.

**SAFETY NOTE**: Do not use the common FR-4 PCB blanks as these produce very nasty fiberglass dust - only use FR-1!

## Part 2 – Fusion 360 Basics - A few hours
A good video on basics: [Fusion 360 for Beginners Webinar (48min video)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gu7Nm0ygaow)

101 Workshops at the Garage: [Fusion 360 CAD/CNC 101](http://aka.ms/f360cnc)

The Fusion 360 site: [Learning Fusion 360](http://fusion360.autodesk.com/learning/learning.html?guid=GUID-CC9A8E39-356C-43EA-9EDD-0E9C1321E0F2)
The following modules will be of most use for CNC Milling:
* Getting Oriented
* Sketch
* Modeling
* CAM 

You can also do this _after_ doing Part 3



## Part 3 – Milling from an existing Fusion 360 project - Apx 2 hours 
** !!!!!!! Please do not use metal - use the MDF board instead. !!!!!!!!!**

Link: [Making a custom ring](https://othermachine.co/support/tutorials/custom-aluminum-and-brass-rings/)

You will learn the workflow from CAM software (what you use to go from a 3D design to a series of machining operations) to a CNC mill. Most of the complicated aspects of 3D design and machining are already defined so you can focus on the workflow.

Go through the course by installing software on your own computer. You will only need the **Othermill** for the last step (machining the part). 

Link to the required 3D file: [Ring Fusion file.f3d](http://www.instructables.com/files/orig/FCJ/25ST/IDBI2TN1/FCJ25STIDBI2TN1.f3d) (Make sure to save as "Ring Fusion file.f3d")


## Part 4 – Complete a simple project end-to-end 
_This is a prereq to taking training for using the larger mills._ 

Design a simple object in Fusion 360, setup machining steps in Fusion 360, simulate, mill it on the **Othermill** and mail   **MakerGarageCNC**.
